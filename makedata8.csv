Dark Chocolate Sandesh (Shondesh) Dipped In Chocolate Recipe,",2 liter Milk , full fat,Lemon juice , from one or two lemons,200 grams Dark chocolate,3-4 tablespoons Condensed Milk,1 tablespoon Cocoa Powder,1/2 teaspoon Vanilla Extract,1/4 cup Raisins , finely chopped,2 tablespoons Slivered Almonds (Badam)",15,35,50,10,Bengali Recipes,Dessert,Vegetarian,"To begin making the Dark Chocolate Sandesh (Shondesh) Dipped In Chocolate Recipe, first prepare the chenna or fresh cottage cheese, which is the base for many Bengali sweets.To do this, place the full fat milk in a saucepan or heavy bottomed pan and bring it to a boil. Once the milk is bubbling away, add the lemon juice and turn off the heat. The milk will curdle and coagulate within seconds.Once the entire milk has coagulated and you see the cheese floating on top and a clear whey separated from it. Prepare the chenna and rinse it under running water thoroughly. Tie it in a cheese cloth and hang it to drain out the excess water. This process takes at least for a couple of hours.In the meantime, chop the dark chocolate into small chunks to make it easier to melt. Place a sauce pan with water over a medium heat. In a heatproof bowl which is slightly larger than the saucepan, add the chopped chocolate and place this bowl over the saucepan, ensuring that the boiling water doesn’t touch the surface of the heatproof bowl.The heat generated by the boiling water will melt the chocolate gently. Lower the heat and begin to melt the chocolate with a spatula, till it is smooth and glossy.Add the cocoa powder and vanilla essence to the melted chocolate and keep it aside.Time to check on the chenna once again. Once most of the water is drained out, tip the cheese on a flat surface and begin kneading it, pressing it down and forward with the heel of your palm.Working it on the surface like you would dough for chapatis or puris. The kneading is most important as it makes the chenna smooth, and almost like a fine paste by the end of the process.Note: If kneading the sondesh takes too much time and effort, you could also use a food processor. However the result will be a finer paste-like sondesh, while this recipe tastes good when the chenna mix is well-kneaded, but slightly grainy.Reserving about 3 tablespoons of the melted chocolate in a smaller bowl, add the rest of the melted chocolate to the kneaded chenna. Add the condensed milk and once again mix until it is well combined.Heat a heavy bottomed pan and tip the chenna mixture into it. Cook on medium heat until the mixture begins to leave the sides of the pan and come together as a ball.Remove the mixture from the heat, add the raisins and mix well. Once it is cool enough to work with, divide the chenna into 12 equal parts. Shape them into round balls and lightly flatten each by patting them softly with your fingers.Dip half the balls in melted chocolate reserved separately earlier and top it off with roasted slivered almonds. Place the balls chocolate side up, to set a little.Serve the Dark Chocolate Sandesh on Angoori Rasmalai.

When the milk comes to a roaring boil, add orange juice, orange zest and vinegar. The milk will curdle immediately. Turn off the heat and let the curdled milk rest for 3-4 minutes in its whey.After about 3 to 4 minutes, strain the curdled milk onto a cheesecloth or a cloth strainer. Let it drip and drain until all the whey has drained out and we have thick cottage cheese (chenna). This will take a few hours. So proceed to the next steps once the chenna is ready.Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 liter milk in a heavy bottom pan and cook on medium heat till the milk has reduced to half. Keep stirring the milk occasionally to prevent the milk from getting settled at the bottom of the pan.Once the milk has reduced to half its quantity, add the 1/2 cup sugar, a pinch of orange color and orange essence to the reduced milk and keep this aside. Pour the reduced milk into a serving bowl which is large enough to hold the cooked chenna balls.Once the chenna is ready, we will proceed to shape the chenna. Place the chenna into a bowl, add arrowroot powder and a pinch of orange color to it. Mash the chenna with the heels of your palm till smooth. The process is more like a kneading and mash technique that makes the chenna soft. Continue with the knead and mash motion until the chenna feels soft.Once the chenna is soft, shape the chenna into 12 to 15 small balls and flatten them slightly. Keep these balls aside.The next step is to cook the chenna - yes its double cooking process to get the spongy nature of the cottage cheese balls in the Ras Malai.To begin, heat water and 1-1/2 cup sugar in a pressure cooker. Stir well until all the sugar has dissolved completely. When the water comes to a rolling boil, add a few chenna balls in the pressure cooker. Cover the lid, place the weight on and cook the chenna balls for 2 whistles on high heat.Remove the pressure cookerAfter the two whistles, turn off the heat, place the pressure cooker under running water to release the pressure immediately. The process of placing the pressure cooker under cold water ensures safety when releasing the pressure.Once you open, you will notice the Chenna Balls would have puffed up and expanded. Remove the cooked chenna balls using a slotted spoon and add them to the reduced milk.Cook the remaining chenna balls in the same manner and add them to the reduced milk.

"Homemade Quick Puff Pastry Sheet Recipe | Perfect For Puffs, Tarts & Pies.",",315 grams All Purpose Flour (Maida),5 grams Salt,220 grams Butter (unsalted) , chilled and chopped into 3/4 inch pieces,120 ml Chilled water",1440,0,1440,2,Continental,Vegetarian,Vegetarian,"To begin making the Quick Puff Pastry Recipe Sheet for making puffs, measure all the ingredients and keep them ready.Add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl and give a quick stir to combine it. Add the large cubes of butter into the flour mixture.Ensure each piece of butter is coated fully into flour. When it is coated in flour it will be less likely to melt and also less likely to melt out of the dough later when we roll to make the sheets.This process of covering the butter with flour is called lamination of the butter with flour. If it is not laminated well, the butter will melt out of the dough and you will end up with a puff that is not flaky. Next, squish up the cubes of butter coated with flour by pressing between your fingers.  Like shown in the image below.Once all the pieces are squished, just toss them in flour once again. You need to ensure all the butter pieces are well coated with flour.Make a well in the center and add little ice water at a time. Starting with 1/3 cup and then adding more if required a tablespoon at a time. Because every single brand of flour absorbs moisture differently, we need to ensure we add that water little at a time. To mix the water in, toss the flour into the water and it helps the water get incorporated to form the dough without kneading. Do not knead the dough, as it can activate too much gluten.When it gets to a stage where the puff pastry dough forms large clumps, you can knead a little to understand how much more moisture is needed to bring the dough together without breaking those butter shingles. Add a few tablespoons of water if needed again to bring the dry flour together to form the dough. It is important to get the dough to the right hydration level. If it becomes too wet, then the dough will become sticky and might not be the best thing for puff pastry. Gently press and bring the flour together to form a dough without kneading. It is important to work as quickly as possible. If you take too long and knead too long the heat from your hands will melt the butter and make it sticky. We need to ensure that the butter is still in big pieces in the dough after bringing it together.The dough will look rough and not smooth and you will be able to see the big chunks of butter and will not look totally smooth.Divide the dough in two halves and shape each piece into an almost square disk.Wrap each disc of dough in a plastic/ cling film wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. Based on the warmth and the humidity of the region, a minimum one hour will allow the dough to rest before we begin the folds to make the puff pastry sheet.After one hour, remove the dough from the refrigerator.Dust the working surface with very little flour. Open one of the discs while the other is still in refrigeration. First RoundRoll out the dough into a rough rectangle shape to about 1/2 inch thickness. The dough will be tough, so use a little muscle to roll it out.If you feel the dough is sticky with butter, sprinkle a little bit of flour in the area where the butter feels sticky.  Ensure you dust off any excess flour.Once you have rolled it into a 1/2 inch thick rectangle, fold the dough into half and then fold the half into a quarter again. This is the first fold. We will proceed to make the 2nd fold in the same round.Dust a little flour if required and roll into a 1/2 inch rectangle again and then do the folds (first into half and then again fold the half into a quarter).Wrap this dough the same cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour until the dough is firm.Second RoundAfter an hour, repeat the process mentioned in the first round again. Once you are done with at least 3 to 4 rounds of rolling, folding and chilling process, the puff pastry dough is ready. You need to ensure you refrigerate the puff pastry dough for at least 6 to 8 hours before you are ready to use it to make puffs, tarts and more. These puff pastry sheets can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 to 4 months. When you are ready to use them, thaw for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature and begin using it for the recipes.

Spinach Khandvi Recipe - Savory Gram Flour Pinwheels With Spinach,",1 cup Gram flour (besan),1 cup Curd (Dahi / Yogurt),100 grams Spinach Leaves (Palak) , roughly chopped,1-1/4 cups Water,1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi),1/4 teaspoon Asafoetida (hing),1/4 teaspoon Sugar,Salt , to taste,1/2 teaspoon Mustard seeds,1/2 teaspoon Cumin seeds (Jeera),1 teaspoon Sesame seeds (Til seeds),6 Curry leaves,2 tablespoons Fresh coconut , grated,2 tablespoons Coriander (Dhania) Leaves , chopped,2 teaspoons Sunflower Oil",10,40,50,4,Gujarati Recipes﻿,Lunch,Vegetarian,"To begin making the Spinach Khandvi Recipe, into a blender combine the besan, curd, spinach leaves, turmeric powder, asafoetida powder,  sugar, salt  and blitz it once, once it has all come together. Open the mixer jar add about a cup of water and blitz the mixture once again. When you blend, add the water little at a time, so we get a finely pureed spinach mixture.Before we proceed to the next step, we need to prepare the work surface to make Khandvi. It is important to have a smooth surface and the ideal is granite counter top. Clean the counter top thoroughly as you will be spreading the cooked gram flour mixture. If you don't have a granite counter top, then you can use a flat plate or a smooth cookie sheet big enough to spread the mixture. If you do it on plates, or cookie sheets, you will probably have to spread the mixture in multiple rounds. The number of these plates you need will depend on how thin you spread the mixture. My estimate is about 3-4 plates of 12 inch diameter. Also if you use plates or cookie sheets, spread them on the back side.Transfer the khandvi batter into a non-stick pan and heat on low to medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent lump formation. Continue stirring on low heat, till the mixture thickens for 15 minutes.The mixture will begin to attain a shine. Once you notice the Khandvi batter has a shine to it and has thickened, turn off the heat. Keep the mixture covered, so it remains hot while you proceed to the steps below, as it will not spread when it cools down.Spread the hot mixture on the prepared surface as thinly as possible, with a flat spatula. When you have finished spreading the batter, allow it to cool a little and settle down about three minutes and not less. Repeat this process and continue to spread the entire mixture, before it cools down.After about 10 minutes have passed begin rolling the mixture into a log starting from the top. Once the rolls have been made, cut the rolls into one inch size logs. Place the cut rolls on a serving platter.Heat oil in a pan for seasoning; add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, curry leaves allow them to crackle.Sprinkle the seasoning over the rolls and garnish with coriander leaves and coconut. This can be made one day ahead and kept in the refrigerator and warmed up in the microwave before serving.Serve Spinach Khandvi as a side dish along with Gujarati Dal, Aloo Bhindi and Hot Phulkas for your weekday lunch.

Puri for Pani Puri Recipe -Golgappa/ Puchka Puri Recipe,",1 cup Sooji (Semolina/ Rava),1 tablespoon All Purpose Flour (Maida),1/2 teaspoon Salt,1 tablespoon Sunflower Oil,1/4 cup Lukewarm Water,Sunflower Oil , for deep frying",5,45,50,40,North Indian Recipes,Snack,Vegetarian,"To begin making the Puri for Pani Puri, in a large bowl, add in the salt, sooji rava and the warm water. Mix the ingredients well until the sooji rava has absorbed all the water. The mixture will resemble a wet crumb texture.With this existing moisture we need to make this into a smooth dough. For that add in a tablespoon of maida (all purpose flour). This flour is to absorb that extra moisture and give it a bit of gluten for the dough. Resist the temptation to add more flour, this will alter the texture of the puri for the pani puriKnead this dough well for about 10 minutes continuously. It will be easier to knead it on your kitchen platform rather than the bowl. You can use both your hands and muscle power to get the sooji rava mixture into a consistency of a smooth dough. The dough should not be super stiff. It should be firm, yet smooth and pliable.NOTE: Do time yourself and knead for 10 minutes and not any less (smiles)The kneading helps the dough develop the gluten and the warmth of your hand helps it get softer. This gluten will help the puri’s puff in the oil and turn crisp as well.Also note, the dough should not be soft, it should be medium tight and not hard. Hence kneading well helps give that smooth finishAfter kneading the dough for 10 minutes, add in 1 tablespoon of oil. It is important that you add the oil only after kneading the dough and not in the beginning. This will give the crunch to the dough that a puri of the pani puri should have.Knead this pani puri dough for another 3 minutes (put a timer on)Now cover the dough either in a box with a lid or invert a bowl over it. This helps the dough to sweat and form its gluten and softness. Allow the dough to rest for at least 30 minutes.Once the dough is well rested for 30 minutes, knead the dough once again for another 2 minutes (set the timer on)Once kneaded, we will now use a cookie cutter or the cap of the cocktail shaker to cut the puri’s for the pani puri.Preheat the oil for deep frying the puri for the pani puri.Divide the dough in 3 small portions. Take one portion out and keep the rest covered. Roll the dough into a thin sheet and using a cutter make rounds of the dough.I like to roll these rounds a little more with a rolling pin just to make sure you get the perfect thickness.Keep adding one puri at a time into the preheat oil and fry the puri’s on low to medium heat (not high heat), until they puff and turn golden brown on both sides.Note: The puri’s have to fry on low to medium heat to get that perfect crispness.Drain the puri’s once they turn golden brown on absorbent paper.Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the dough.Serve these  Puris with Pani to make Pani Puris | Golgappas | Puchka’s the most famous street food snack of india.

Whisk them together and set aside while you begin to prep for caramelising the sugar.Heat a heavy bottomed pan, add ghee and once it begins to get hot (not smoking), reduce the heat to medium. Add sugar and level it in ghee using a spatula. After five minutes stir the sugar using a spatula (using spatula helps ensure that the caramel won’t stick to it). Keep stirring once in a while till the sugar starts caramelizing as it melts. (The colour of the caramel should not deepen or darken in colour as this will lead to a bitter tasting halwa)Give a quick stir to the flour-semolina batter and slowly add it to the caramelised sugar.Now, starts the tricky part. Hold the wok or pan firmly using a cloth or holder (to avoid the heat) so that you can work your way with the batter. Using ladle (a large heavy spoon/ kalchhul), carefully yet swiftly start mixing the batter into the caramel. The batter will seem to turn lumpy but nothing to worry.Increase the flame to medium and using the back of the spoon keep smashing the batter, especially the whitish lumps, till the whole batter gets completed assimilated and incorporated with the caramel and the halwa wears a homogeneous look.This process will take approximately 3 to 4 minutes. You will also notice that the halwa releases the oil as it begins to come together as evenly toned mixture. At this point, remove excess oil in a small bowl and again roast the halwa for 3 to 4 minutes. Switch off the heat and push the halwa towards the edge of one side of the wok to allow any excess ghee to drain in the centre. Once the ghee leaves the halwa, drain it out in the bowl. Halwa is now ready to be served!Serve Mukhadi Halwa as a dessert after your weekday meal of Dal Makhani, Aloo Ki Sabzi and Phulka.

Dont over beat, we just want all the ingredients to be well combined.Spoon the above cake mixture into the spring foam pan and level the surface with the back of a spoon. Bake for 1 and a half hours approximately or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.The cake typically tends to darken a lot during baking, if this happens cover the top with parchment paper in the middle of the baking process.Once the christmas cake is baked remove it from the oven allow it to cool completely in the pan.Store the Christmas Cake (eggless/ vegan) in an airtight container, wrapped in greaseproof paper and aluminium foil, for two to three months.You can also bake the Traditional Christmas Cake in smaller pans and gift them to your family this holiday season.Serve the Traditional Christmas Cake along with Qahwa | Arabic Coffee Recipe and Ginger Cardamom Chai (Spice Infused Indian Style Milk Tea) to compliment the cake for your evening.
