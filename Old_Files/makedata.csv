How to make Dry Navratan Korma Recipe 
To begin making Dry Navratan Korma Recipe, prepare and keep all the ingredients on the kitchen counter first.Heat a little oil in a shallow frying pan and shallow fry the paneer chunks on all sides till crisp and keep aside on a kitchen towel to drain any excess oil.Add more oil if required, add whole spices mentioned, and as soon as they crackle, add onions and saute till they soften and are translucent.Now add chopped ginger garlic and green chilies and fry till raw smell goes and turns brownish in color.Now add tomato puree and saute till the raw smell disappears.Add all the chopped vegetables and peas excluding paneer, nuts, and fruits.Mix well and add coriander powder, red chili powder and kitchen king masala or garam masala and fry till cooked well.Add a little oil if you feel that the curry is too dry. Now add cashew paste and fresh cream.Mix well till everything incorporates well with each other. You may see the curry getting thicker, so add little water, around 1/2 cup and stir and allow the vegetables to cook on low flame. Keep the lid closed.This may take around 7-8 minutes.Once you see the vegetables softening, add raisins and split cashew nuts and mix well.Cook for another few minutes until cashews and raisins are incorporated with flavours.Let all the vegetables be cooked to el dente, and not soggy.Now add the pineapple chunks and half of the pomegranate, mix and turn off the gas flames.Add fried paneer pieces on the top and garnish with freshly chopped coriander, some split cashews, and pomegranate pearls.Serve Dry Navratan Korma along with Dal Banjara Recipe and Phulkas for an everyday meal.
